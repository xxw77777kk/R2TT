**R2TT: High-Accuracy 3D Localization Using Ray-Tracing-Based Wi-Fi RTT Virtual Fingerprints for Challenging Scenarios.** 

**R2TT** R2TT (Ray-Tracing Round-Trip Time) is a high-precision 3D indoor positioning system that combines the advantages of fingerprint-based and ranging-based methods by leveraging virtual RTT ranging fingerprints. The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) constructing a virtual RTT fingerprint database using low-cost light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ray tracing techniques and (2) employing deep learning to capture signal reflection characteristics for robust and high-accuracy localization.
